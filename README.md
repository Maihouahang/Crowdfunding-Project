# Crowdfunding-Project
Almost all functions used in this data analysis was knowledge learned from the EdX bootcamp course, excluding the exceptions mentioned below. 

For the Goal Analysis worksheet, I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help me with how to use the COUNTIF function when looking for less than, greater than, and equal to. 

For the Statistical Analysis worksheet, instead of using knowledge learned from the bootcamp course, I used Xpert Learning Assistant, which taught me to use the fliter function. This function helped me to pull out all the successful and failed campaigns from the Crowdfunding worksheet.
